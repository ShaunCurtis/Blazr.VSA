# Blazr.Invoice

**Under Construction - There are only so many hours in a day!**

This Repo contains a solution and documentation demonstrating how to build a project in Blazor.

It's based on a very simplistic Customer/Invoice scenario.  It's purpose is to demonstrate managing complex domain entities, such as invoices.

At the moment the Blazr Server project is the only working solution.

All the documentation is under construction.
